# Polaris

## What is Polaris?
A scripting language with shell scripting capabilities (WIP) 

## Installation
Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) and run ```opam init```

Then run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Innf107/polaris
cd polaris
./install.sh
```

And you're done!

To check your installation, you might want to run the polaris repl (Ctrl + D to exit)
```
polaris
```

If you have any trouble building polaris, feel free to open an issue.

## Documentation?
Polaris is still very unstable at the moment. There will be proper documentation once the type system is stable enough. If you have any concrete questions, you can open an issue, but please don't expect to be able to use Polaris for now.
