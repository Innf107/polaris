# Polaris

Polaris is a statically typed, fully inferred programming language with first class access to shell scripting capabilities.

## Installation
Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) and run ```opam init```

Then run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Innf107/polaris
cd polaris
opam install .
```

And you're done!

To check your installation, run
```
polaris --help
```

If you have any trouble building polaris, feel free to open an issue.


## Documentation
Polaris is still very unstable at the moment. There will be proper documentation once the type system is stable enough. If you have any concrete questions, you can open an issue, but please don't expect to be able to use Polaris for now.
